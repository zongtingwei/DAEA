## üìñ Introduction

DAEA is a MATLAB-based evolutionary algorithm designed for solving biobjective feature selection problems in classification tasks. It leverages duplication analysis to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the feature selection process.

This implementation is based on the code of [SM-MOEA](https://github.com/BIMK/SM-MOEA) and [PlatEMO](https://github.com/BIMK/PlatEMO). Please refer to the original paper [A Duplication Analysis-Based Evolutionary Algorithm for Biobjective Feature Selection](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9165863) for detailed information about the algorithm's overview, methodology, and benchmark results.

This code was developed for feature selection tasks in classification. The framework can be adapted to other feature selection scenarios with minor modifications.
