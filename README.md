# DAEA_FS
DAEA code for solving multi-objective feature selection problems in classification without using PLATEMO
### Abstract:
Reference: Xu H, Xue B, Zhang M. A duplication analysis-based evolutionary algorithm for biobjective feature selection[J]. IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 2020, 25(2): 205-218.
### Acknowledgement:
The implementation is based on the code of [SM-MOEA](https://github.com/BIMK/SM-MOEA) and [PLATEMO](https://github.com/BIMK/PlatEMO). Thanks to them.
### Run:
You can use the main_DAEA.m and the 'colon.mat' file in the 'dataset' folder to run this algorithm.
